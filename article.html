        <hr><br><p>Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans and birds, they cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. In cows and pigs they cause diarrhea, while in mice they cause hepatitis and encephalomyelitis.
            Coronaviruses constitute the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, and realm Riboviria. They are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry. The genome size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately 26 to 32 kilobases, one of the largest among RNA viruses. They have characteristic club-shaped spikes that project from their surface, which in electron micrographs create an image reminiscent of the solar corona, from which their name derives

            <p>The earliest reports of a coronavirus infection in animals occurred in the late 1920s, when an acute respiratory infection of domesticated chickens emerged in North America. Arthur Schalk and M.C. Hawn in 1931 made the first detailed report which described a new respiratory infection of chickens in North Dakota. The infection of new-born chicks was characterized by gasping and listlessness with high mortality rates of 40–90%. Leland David Bushnell and Carl Alfred Brandly isolated the virus that caused the infection in 1933.  The virus was then known as infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Charles D. Hudson and Fred Robert Beaudette cultivated the virus for the first time in 1937.  The specimen came to be known as the Beaudette strain. In the late 1940s, two more animal coronaviruses, JHM that causes brain disease (murine encephalitis) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) that causes hepatitis in mice were discovered. It was not realized at the time that these three different viruses were related. 
                Human coronaviruses were discovered in the 1960s using two different methods in the United Kingdom and the United States . E.C. Kendall, Malcolm Bynoe, and David Tyrrell working at the Common Cold Unit of the British Medical Research Council collected a unique common cold virus designated B814 in 1961. The virus could not be cultivated using standard techniques which had successfully cultivated rhinoviruses, adenoviruses and other known common cold viruses. In 1965, Tyrrell and Bynoe successfully cultivated the novel virus by serially passing it through organ culture of human embryonic trachea. The new cultivating method was introduced to the lab by Bertil Hoorn.[29] The isolated virus when intranasally inoculated into volunteers caused a cold and was inactivated by ether which indicated it had a lipid envelope. Dorothy Hamre and John Procknow at the University of Chicago isolated a novel cold from medical students in 1962. They isolated and grew the virus in kidney tissue culture, designating it 229E. The novel virus caused a cold in volunteers and, like B814, was inactivated by ether.

                Scottish virologist June Almeida at St. Thomas Hospital in London, collaborating with Tyrrell, compared the structures of IBV, B814 and 229E in 1967. Using electron microscopy the three viruses were shown to be morphologically related by their general shape and distinctive club-like spikes. A research group at the National Institute of Health the same year was able to isolate another member of this new group of viruses using organ culture and named one of the samples OC43 (OC for organ culture). Like B814, 229E, and IBV, the novel cold virus OC43 had distinctive club-like spikes when observed with the electron microscope.[37][38]
The IBV-like novel cold viruses were soon shown to be also morphologically related to the mouse hepatitis virus. This new group of viruses were named coronaviruses after their distinctive morphological appearance,Human coronavirus 229E and human coronavirus OC43 continued to be studied in subsequent decades. The coronavirus strain B814 was lost. It is not known which present human coronavirus it was. Other human coronaviruses have since been identified, including SARS-CoV in 2003, HCoV NL63 in 2003, HCoV HKU1 in 2004, MERS-CoV in 2013, and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019[  There have also been a large number of animal coronaviruses identified since the 1960s.

        <br>
        <div style="padding-top:10px; padding-left:40px;"><article style="padding-top: 10px;  color:blueviolet; font-size:20px;">The disease appears to have originated from a Wuhan seafood market where wild animals, including marmots, birds, rabbits, bats and snakes, are traded illegally. Coronaviruses are known to jump from animals to humans, so it’s thought that the first people infected with the disease – a group primarily made up of stallholders from the seafood market – contracted it from contact with animals.
            The hunt for the animal source of Covid-19 is still unknown, although there are some strong contenders. A team of virologists at the Wuhan Institute for Virology released a detailed paper showing that the new coronaviruses' genetic makeup is 96 per cent identical to that of a coronavirus found in bats, while a study published on March 26 argues that genetic sequences of coronavirus in pangolins are between 88.5 and 92.4 per cent similar to the human virus. Some early cases of Covid-19, however, appear to have inflicted people with no link to the Wuhan market at all, suggesting that the initial route of human infection may pre-date the market cases.
            The Wuhan market was shut down for inspection and cleaning on January 1, but by then it appears that Covid-19 was already starting to spread beyond the market itself. On January 21, the WHO Western Pacific office said the disease was also being transmitted between humans – evidence of which is apparent after medical staff became infected with the virus.

        <div style="padding-top:10px; padding-left:40px;"><article style="padding-top: 10px;  color:blueviolet; font-size:20px;">Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that are known to infect both humans and animals, and in humans cause respiratory illness that range from common colds to much more serious infections. The most well-known case of a coronavirus epidemic was Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars), which, after first being detected in southern China in 2002, went on to affect 26 countries and resulted in more than 8,000 cases and 774 deaths.
            While the cause of the current outbreak was initially unknown, on January 7 Chinese health authorities identified that it was caused by to a strain of coronavirus that hadn’t been encountered in humans before. Five days later the Chinese government shared the genetic sequence of the virus so that other countries could develop their own diagnostic kits. That virus is now called Sars-CoV-2.
            Although symptoms of coronaviruses are often mild – the most common symptoms are a fever and dry cough – in some cases they lead to more serious respiratory tract illness including pneumonia and bronchitis. These can be particularly dangerous in older patients, or people who have existing health conditions, and this appears to be the case with Covid-19. A study of 44,415 early Chinese Covid-19 patients found that 81 per cent of people with confirmed infections experienced only mild symptoms. Of the remaining cases, 14 per cent were in a severe condition while five per cent of people were critical cases, suffering from respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure. In the Chinese study, 2.3 per cent of all confirmed cases died, although the actual death rate is probably much lower as many more people will have been infected with the virus than tested positive

        <br>
        <div style="padding-top:10px; padding-left:40px;"><article style="padding-top: 10px;  color:blueviolet; font-size:20px;">Scientists have experimentally identified that there are two possible reasons for the disease from coronavirus:
               Consumption of wildlife foods such as bats: The most common cause of the infection of the coronavirus is eating wild animals. Most of the cases have come across for eating bats and snakes.
               Animal pathogens: The body physiology of every animal is different; thus, every animal have some specific micro-organism residing in their body — Eating them affects the incompatibility in the creature and the chance of traditional suffering increases.
               Transmission: Transmission of coronavirus takes place while making contact with a surface or object that has the virus and then touching your nose, eyes, or mouth.
            Signs and Symptoms of the Infection:
            Many people get infected with coronaviruses at one point in their lives, but symptoms are typically mild to moderate. In some cases, the viruses can cause lower-respiratory tract illnesses such as pneumonia and bronchitis.
            Coronavirus usually affects the respiratory system in human, so the various symptoms traditionally observed in human beings are:-
               A general feeling of being unwell
               Respiratory illness
               Nose running
               Coughing
               Sore throat
               Fever
               Chills
               Pneumonia
               Difficulty in breathing
               Kidney failure

            <div style="padding-top:10px; padding-left:40px;"><article style="padding-top: 10px;  color:blueviolet; font-size:20px;">The treatment of coronavirus is not available, but following prevention measure suit best for not being the host:
                   Lab tests: One must go for a lab test including the nose, and throat cultures, and blood tests to find out whether he/she is affected by coronavirus or any other type of virus.
                   Self-safety: There is no vaccine for coronavirus. So you should take the prevention measure like washing your hands with soap and warm water. Keep your hands and fingers away from your eyes, mouth, and nose if not washed. Don’t come in contact with infected people.
                   Food management: Treatment of coronavirus infection is in the same way as that of cold virus-like taking plenty of rest, drinking fluids.
                   Drugs: Only take over-the-counter medicine for the treatment of sore throat. But don’t give it to children or teens younger than 19 years of age. Using drugs like ibuprofen or acetaminophen gives you some relief but not the cure.
                   Convalescent plasma treatments: This treatment can save the life of the patient to some months, and none have been FDA-approved. But the exact procedure is not available.

        <div style="padding-top:10px; padding-left:40px;"><article style="padding-top: 10px;  color:blueviolet; font-size:20px;">Most people with human coronavirus illness will recover on their own. You can follow the following pieces of information to protect or relief yourself:
               For children: Do not give Aspirin to children if they are suffering from coronavirus.
               Environmental measure: You can use a room humidifier or a hot shower for easy recovery from sore throat and cough.
               Animal contacts: Don’t come in touch with the most coronavirus transmitting animals like camel, bats, or other wild animals. It would help if you stay away from them.
               Using hankies: Cover your mouth while sneezing. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.</div>
